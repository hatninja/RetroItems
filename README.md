# Retro Items
This mod reimplements how items used to look in minecraft. Item entities are also tweaked to drop individually and avoid merging together.

While working on this, i developed an optional feature which renders all item models as flat, which i think is a really unique way to improve performance and the flat aesthetic.

# Building
To build, run gradle with `./gradlew build`
